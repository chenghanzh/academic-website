I"Q<p>I am a second-year master student at <a href="https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/#:~:text=Theory%20of%20Computation%20at%20Princeton,enable%20much%20of%20modern%20computing.">Princeton University Theory of Computation group</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/">Matt Weinberg</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the interface of Computer Science and Economics, where I am interested in leveraging algorithm design to expand the frontier of Economics theory. My main approach utilizes theoretical techniques from optimization, probabilistic theory, complexity, graph theory, etc. I had experience doing research in algorithmic information design, algorithmic auction design, and am currently devoting myself to understanding economic implications in blockchain.</p>

<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at University of Virginia, where I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://www.haifeng-xu.com/">Haifeng Xu</a> (now at the Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at UChicago). After graduation, I spent a year working with <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/">Pinyan Lu</a> as a visiting student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
