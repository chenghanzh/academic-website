I am a first-yar Computer Science PhD student at [Stanford Theory Group](https://theory.stanford.edu/main/index.shtml). My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Science and Economics, where I am interested in considering incentives to design computer systems with desired properties (e.g., efficiency, fairness. Part of my job is to identify and define these properties). My main approach utilizes theoretical techniques from optimization, probability, complexity, graph theory, etc. In the past few years, I had experience doing research in algorithmic information design, algorithmic auction design, matching markets, and mechanism design for blockchains.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at University of Virginia, where I had the pleasure of working with [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) (now at the Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at UChicago). After graduation, I spent a year working with [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) as a visiting student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I recently graduated with an M.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).
