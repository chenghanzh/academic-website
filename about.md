I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at [Stanford Theory Group](https://theory.stanford.edu/main/index.shtml), where I am advised by [Ashish Goel](https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/ashishg.html) and co-advised by [Aviad Rubinstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~aviad/). My research sits at the interface of computer science and economics, with a focus on analyzing of blockchain markets and designing mechanisms. Applying and expanding knowledge from algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, social choice, optimization, and complexity theory, I aim to design mechanisms and proves limits for key blockchain desiderata, including MEV reallocation, censorship resistance, strategic manipulation, coalition formation and centripetal force, etc. My work focuses on generating rigorous results that can translate into guidance for design, such as explicit assumptions linked to protocol parameters; quantitative guarantees that clarify trade-offs; and impossibility frontiers that mark what no mechanism can achieve.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at University of Virginia, where I had the pleasure of working with [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) (now at the Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at UChicago). After graduation, I spent a year working with [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) as a visiting student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. In May 2024, I graduated with an M.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).
