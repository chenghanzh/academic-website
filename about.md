I am a second-year master student at [Princeton University Theory of Computation group](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/#:~:text=Theory%20of%20Computation%20at%20Princeton,enable%20much%20of%20modern%20computing.), where I am fortunately advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

My research focuses on the interface of Computer Science and Economics, where I am interested in leveraging algorithm design to expand the frontier of Economics theory. My main approach utilizes theoretical techniques from optimization, probabilistic theory, complexity, graph theory, etc. I had experience doing research in algorithmic information design, algorithmic auction design, and am currently devoting myself to understanding economic implications in blockchain.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at University of Virginia, where I had the pleasure of working with [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) (now at the Department of Computer Science and Data Science Institute at UChicago). After graduation, I spent a year working with [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) as a visiting student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Check here for my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/files/Chenghan%20Zhou-CV.pdf).
